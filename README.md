# üéØ Microsoft Sentinel Analytics Rules

This repository contains a curated collection of custom **Microsoft Sentinel Analytics Rules** designed to enhance threat detection and support a Zero Trust security strategy.

## üîç Overview

The rules included in this repository help detect:

- üîê Brute-force and credential stuffing attempts  
- üåç Impossible travel and location anomalies

- üì§ Sensitive data exfiltration via email  
- üß¨ Endpoint threats (e.g., credential dumping)

Each rule is written in **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** and can be directly imported into Microsoft Sentinel.

2. Navigate to **Analytics > Create > Scheduled query rule**.

5. Save and activate the rule.

> Each `.rule` file contains metadata, severity level, MITRE mapping, and the detection logic.
